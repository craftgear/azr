# Intelligent Paging Implementation Todo List

## Project Overview
Create an intelligent paging function that handles text pagination more intelligently by considering semantic boundaries, content complexity, and reading flow optimization.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis
- [x] Explore existing codebase paging implementation
- [x] Analyze current paging patterns in `pageDivider.ts`
- [x] Study capacity calculation in `readerCapacityCalculator.ts`
- [x] Review viewport calculations in `viewportTextCalculator.ts`
- [x] Identify improvement opportunities and pain points

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development Setup
- [ ] Create test file `intelligentPageDivider.test.ts`
- [ ] Write failing tests for semantic boundary detection
- [ ] Write failing tests for content complexity scoring
- [ ] Write failing tests for look-ahead optimization
- [ ] Write failing tests for adaptive capacity calculation

### 2.2 Core Algorithm Implementation
- [ ] Create `intelligentPageDivider.ts` module
- [ ] Implement Japanese text boundary detection (句読点、改行)
- [ ] Create content complexity scoring algorithm
  - [ ] Ruby density calculation
  - [ ] Special character frequency analysis
  - [ ] Emphasis and formatting complexity
- [ ] Implement look-ahead optimization algorithm
- [ ] Create adaptive capacity adjustment logic

### 2.3 Semantic Analysis Features
- [ ] Detect sentence boundaries (。！？)
- [ ] Identify paragraph breaks and natural pauses
- [ ] Recognize dialogue patterns (「」)
- [ ] Handle poetry and structured text formats
- [ ] Create penalty system for poor break points

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 3.1 Content-Aware Adjustments
- [ ] Dynamic page size based on content density
- [ ] Ruby-heavy content handling
- [ ] Long dialogue optimization
- [ ] Heading and section management
- [ ] Bibliography and reference handling

### 3.2 Reading Flow Optimization
- [ ] Page balance algorithm (avoid very short/long pages)
- [ ] Chapter and section awareness
- [ ] Cliffhanger detection and management
- [ ] Reading rhythm maintenance

### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Caching for repeated calculations
- [ ] Incremental processing for large documents
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Processing time benchmarks

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing

### 4.1 API Design
- [ ] Design clean API compatible with existing code
- [ ] Create configuration options for different modes
- [ ] Implement fallback to basic paging if needed
- [ ] Add debugging and analysis tools

### 4.2 Integration with Reader Component
- [ ] Modify `Reader.tsx` to use intelligent paging optionally
- [ ] Add settings toggle for intelligent vs basic paging
- [ ] Ensure smooth navigation between modes
- [ ] Test with various document types

### 4.3 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Integration tests with real Aozora Bunko texts
- [ ] Performance testing with large documents
- [ ] Edge case testing (empty pages, special characters)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Phase 5: Documentation & Refinement

### 5.1 Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive function documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples and best practices
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add performance guidelines

### 5.2 Code Quality
- [ ] Run linting and type checking
- [ ] Code review and refactoring
- [ ] Optimize for maintainability
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex algorithms

### 5.3 User Experience Testing
- [ ] Test with different font sizes and layouts
- [ ] Validate with various Japanese text types
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
- [ ] Gather feedback on reading experience

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Pages break at natural reading points (sentences, paragraphs)
- [ ] Content complexity is properly handled (ruby, emphasis)
- [ ] Reading flow feels natural and uninterrupted
- [ ] Performance is comparable to or better than existing system
- [ ] All existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] Code is well-tested and maintainable

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Code Style**: Follow existing project conventions
- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing `AozoraNode` and `Page` types
- **Performance Target**: Process typical Aozora Bunko text (10,000+ characters) in <100ms

## Notes
- Follow TDD methodology: Red → Green → Refactor
- Separate structural changes from behavioral changes
- Make incremental commits with clear messages
- Consider Japanese text-specific requirements throughout development
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing paging system
